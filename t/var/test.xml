			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become increasingly frustrated with how I spend my free time. Bouncing back and forth and back and forth between <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, and having a constant drip of information straight to me.  It&#8217;s come to the point now, where my attention span is terrible &#8211; I can go barely half an hour without needing to find something funny to look at, or a new video to watch, or catch up on some technology that I&#8217;m going to forget 10 seconds later that has <em>zero</em> impact on my life.</p>
<p>I often spend time thinking back to myself as a child. There were things I do differently in life now, but there are still a lot of traits that I&#8217;ve lost as a kid. The fascination with everything, a need to understand &#8211; really understand &#8211; how everything worked. I could spend hours hacking away at little things and feel that joy and buzz when I got it working. I don&#8217;t get this so much anymore.</p>
<p>Part of it is growing up, no doubt. I&#8217;m 7 years older than these first memories &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to constantly understand new things, because there is a limit to the speed at which you can discover stuff. But the larger problem is just that I&#8217;m not trying! I still have the ideas, but there is no development. An idea might make it to a repository, but die out shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not suggesting I finish all these projects &#8211; there are countless past projects that never made it anywhere. However, there were projects that did have longevity &#8211; now there aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So, Reddit, Hacker News, it&#8217;s time to say good bye for now &#8211; it&#8217;s been fun, but you&#8217;re just starting to drain me of creativity. I&#8217;m sure the transitional period is going to be rocky, but I fell this has got to be done!</p>
<p>Now, maybe I can finish reading these books on my self, finish really learning Haskell and Lisp, practice guitar more and continue my piano studies&#8230;</p>
<hr />
Interesting footnote: During the writing of this short post, I was distracted probably 5 times with YouTube and other stuff &#8211; at one point entirely forgetting what I was writing about.</p>
