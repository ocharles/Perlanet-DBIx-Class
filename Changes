Revision history for Perlanet-DBIx-Class

0.02 Tue 8 Jun, 2010

    * Added roles that post and feed result sets must consume:
        - Perlanet::DBIx::Class::Role::FeedResultSet
        - Perlanet::DBIx::Class::Role::PostResultSet

    * Added automatic de-duplication of posts

      The PostResultSet role now has a `has_post' method which is used
      to determine if a post has already been saved to the database. You
      are welcome to exclude this method and provide your own
      implementation.
